# Since MystenLabs uses Hakari in the sui repository, and we bring narwhal in from there, this
# results into all of their dependencies and packages to be listed in their workspace-hack crate.
# That adds a huge amount of unwanted dependencies to our crate. The `empty-workspace-hack` is an
# empty crate which only depends on `strum` which is the only dependency narwhal cared about.
