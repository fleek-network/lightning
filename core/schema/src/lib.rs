//! The network messages for Fleek Network. The point of this crate is to have one common
//! place where we define the schema for the messages that are part of the network stack.
//!
//! Although serde is great, we want to make it easy to use a schema-based encoder/decoder
//! in the future (such as flatbuffers or protobuf).
//!
//! However, that task can be extra development effort at the current stage, so we would
//! rather use serde for the time being. This crate serves as a layer of abstraction
//! that works over serde + flexbuffers (schema-less cousin of flatbuffers), and makes
//! the entire encoding/decoding effort hot-swappable in one place.
//!
//! Anywhere we need to care about serialization and deserialization of messages we can
//! rely on the [`LightningMessage`] trait to use the encoding and decoding.
